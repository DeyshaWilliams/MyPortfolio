            <h3>
              About Me!
            </h3>
            <p>
              After the pandemic, I realized how much I need to do for me. For years I have been working with children and working on improving my musicianship. I've contemplated what I really want to do with my life and have come to the conclution that I want to make my own video games.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a student of Thinkful, I can make my dream a reality. I am excited to show the world what Dèysha Williams is made of and capable of.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you're looking for a new developer, be sure to reach out! I am more than willing and able to work with you and your team to make something incredible.
